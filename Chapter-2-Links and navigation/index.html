    <h2><u><i>Plot</i></u></h2>

    <p><i>
Kiki, a young witch, embarks on a journey to find a new town to live in, as is the tradition for witches her age. She brings along her talking black cat, Jiji, and uses her mother's old broomstick for her travels. Kiki eventually arrives in the bustling city of Koriko and has a series of misadventures, including accidentally flying through traffic and meeting a boy named Tombo.<br>
<br>In Koriko, Kiki finds a place to stay at the Gutiokipanja bakery, owned by the kind-hearted Osono and her husband, Fukuo. Kiki decides to start a delivery service using her flying abilities and names it the "Witch Delivery Service." Her first delivery involves a mix-up with a stuffed toy and an encounter with a young painter named Ursula.<br>
<br>As Kiki continues her delivery business, she faces various challenges, including losing her ability to fly and communicate with Jiji. This leads to a period of self-doubt and depression. With the help of Ursula and her new friends, Kiki realizes that her crisis is similar to an artist's block and that she needs to find a new purpose.<br>
<br>When an airship accident occurs, Kiki witnesses Tombo in danger and bravely regains her flying powers to rescue him. This act of courage restores her confidence, and she resumes her delivery service, happy and content with her new life in Koriko.

        <h2><u><i>Reviews</i></u></h2>
        <p> "Kiki's Delivery Service is a heartwarming, gorgeously-rendered tale of a young witch discovering her place in the world." <b> - rottentomatoes.com</b></p>
        <p> "A conventional but delightful tale of self-discovery and heroism from Mr. Miyazaki, it feels like Disney one moment, Truffaut the next." <b>- The New Yorks Times</b></p>
        <p> "It’s a sweet, small story that deals comfortably in big emotions when required, whilst also taking time to speculate on the nature of art and the difficulties of navigating adolescence. One of the greatest triumphs of Miyazaki’s movie, however, is how well-defined each of its characters truly are." <b>- CineVue</b></p>
        <p> "While it suffers from the limited facial animation of so many Japanese cartoons, the backgrounds, characterizations and story are consistently pleasing. " <b>- The Seattle Times</b></p>
